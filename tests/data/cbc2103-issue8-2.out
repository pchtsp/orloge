Problem MODEL has 9 rows, 9 columns and 18 elements
Coin0008I MODEL read with 0 errors
Continuous objective value is 32 - 0.00 seconds
Cgl0004I processed model has 7 rows, 9 columns (9 integer (0 of which binary)) and 15 elements
Cutoff increment increased from 1e-05 to 0.9999
Cbc0012I Integer solution of -32 found by DiveCoefficient after 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective -32, took 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 0 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -32 to -32
